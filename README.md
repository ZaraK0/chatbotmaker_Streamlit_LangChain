# Developing a Chatbot with Streamlit, LangChain, and OpenAI
This chat application integrates PDF interaction with the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's language model and LangChain, enabling natural and intuitive conversations with PDF documents. It simplifies information retrieval, analysis, and collaboration like never before.

## LangChain
LangChain is a foundational framework for building applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and innovative applications will not simply treat language models as external tools.

## Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library designed to make it easy to create and share visually appealing custom web applications for machine learning and data science. With Streamlit, you can build and deploy powerful data applications in just minutes, facilitating quick and efficient development.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/zarak0/chatbotmaker_Streamlit_LangChain.git`
